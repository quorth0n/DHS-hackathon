					If you are a mayor/charity of a town or district currently suffering through an emergency (e.g. fires in Napa/Sonoma, earthquakes, house fires, mudslides, etc.), then the website would be the best choice for you. The website offers an array of resources that allows an administrator to add certain charities to the map. Then, the charities are required to state the quantity of what they need and the location of where they are, so supplies can head there way. Additionally, if a natural disaster occurs in which homes are destroyed, then venues can open their doors and offer a temporary living space for these victims by also using the website. 
On the other hand, we have the app. The app displays a map of the world and caters to both receivers and donors. For donors, they are open to a wide list of charities as well as their locations on the map. The pinpoints not only show coordinates, but are color coded to display the varying levels of priority. Those with the red hue are gravely desperate while those in yellow received their supplies and are the least in need. Also, the receivers can travel to the locations on the map that are closest to them and get their supplies. They are open to go to the venues that open their doors to those who lose their homes as well. As one can see, it can go both ways for those using the app.
